            <p> <!--description about me-->
                I am a neurodivergent first-year college student at CIIT College of Arts and Technology, currently pursuing a 
                Bachelor of Science in Entertainment and Multimedia Computing, specializing in Game Development. A hardworking 
                and dedicated student. Focuses on the positive side of things. Very willing to learn new tasks and is open 
                to constructive feedback. Respects diverse perspectives and backgrounds. Believes that “Progress not perfection” 
                is the way to go. <br><br> My dream job is to become a game developer. I want to create games that promote positivity and inclusivity. 
                I want my games to be both enjoyable and would make people relax and forget about their troubles in life.
