                    A project where hardware meets coding. This is a room people counter which senses and records 
                    the number of people entering a room. The counter was placed near a doorway connected to a laptop. 
                    I have programmed it so that when it reaches a certain amount of count, it will beep, 
                    indicating the room has accommodated the maximum number of people it can hold.<br><br>
