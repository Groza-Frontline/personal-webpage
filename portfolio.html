                <p> A project where hardware meets coding. This is a room people counter which senses and records 
                    the number of people entering a room. The counter was placed near a doorway connected to a laptop. 
                    I have programmed it so that when it reaches a certain amount of count, it will beep, 
                    indicating the room has accommodated the maximum number of people it can hold.<br><br></p>

        <h2>My Animation Video using MS Powerpoint and Pixton</h2>
                <p>This is my first Pixton Animation using MS PowerPoint. 
                    I have put my creativity and effort into this project. 
                    It took a lot of time to work on it. But, after finishing it, 
                    I was glad with the final output.</p><br><br><br>
